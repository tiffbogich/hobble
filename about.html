              <h3>The story of hobble...</h3>
              <p>I created this site to try to make it easier for people navigating the NYC subway system on crutches.  I spent three monhts on crutches this fall following an ankle surgery, and as a co-founder of a now 4-person start-up and in the middle of fundraising, I didn't have the luxury of working from home. (That's me on crutches two days post-op after pitching an angel investment group).</p>
              <p>During those three months, I spent an insane amount of money on taxis and ubers and was frustrating over and over again when I got stuck in station without elevators and getting anywhere took forever. The MTA provides A TON of information, but it takes a serious amount of brain cells to work out a fully accessible route from A to B...</p>
              <p>Planned work and feature and function wish lists are posted on Github <a href="https://github.com/tiffbogich/hobble">here</a>. Contributors welcome.</p>
